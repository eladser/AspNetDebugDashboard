## Coding Standards

### C# Code Style
- Follow Microsoft's C# coding conventions
- Use PascalCase for public members
- Use camelCase for private fields and parameters
- Use meaningful names for variables and methods
- Add XML documentation for public APIs
- Use `var` when the type is obvious
- Prefer `async/await` over `Task.Result`

### Example:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Stores a request entry in the database
/// </summary>
/// <param name="request">The request entry to store</param>
/// <returns>The ID of the stored request</returns>
public async Task<string> StoreRequestAsync(RequestEntry request)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test method names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high code coverage

### Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Add XML documentation for public APIs
- Update CHANGELOG.md for notable changes
- Include code examples where helpful
